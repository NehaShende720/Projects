            <p>FAQ is most commonly pronounced as an initialism, "F-A-Q", but may also be pronounced as an acronym, "FAQ". Web designers often label a single list of questions as a "FAQ", such as on Google Search, while using "FAQs" to denote multiple lists of questions such as on United States Treasury sites.</p>

            <p>In contrast to a landing page, where the goal is to convert buyers, the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section is a part of your website where you address common concerns, questions, and objections that customers have.</p>

            <p>The purpose of a FAQ is generally to provide information on frequent questions or concerns; however, the format is a useful means of organizing information, and text consisting of questions and their answers may thus be called a FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked.</p>
